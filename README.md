**Indicator-Based Signal Strength EA for MetaTrader 5**

Nyao Scalper is an automated trading EA designed for scalping on lower timeframes (M1, M5). It uses a **weighted signal scoring system** that aggregates data from multiple technical factors (Trend, Momentum, Volatility, Price Action) into a single confidence score (0.0 - 10.0).

It includes position management, adaptive trailing stops, and lot sizing based on equity performance and signal quality.

## Key Features

### Signal Scoring

The EA calculates a "Signal Score" for every tick based on:

- **Trend**: Fast/Slow EMA crossover and slope alignment.
- **Momentum**: RSI "sweet spots" (trending ranges), breakouts, and candle body momentum.
- **Impulse**: Detects price acceleration and directional continuity (consecutive candles).
- **Volatility**: ATR-based analysis to detect chopping vs. trending markets.
- **Price Action**: Penalizes signals with large opposing wicks (rejection) and rewards breakouts from local peaks.
- **Velocity**: Tracks the _change_ in signal score to detect strengthening or weakening moves.
- **Blended Weighted Average Signal Smoothing**: Combining recent closed candle signals with a configurable dampened current candle contribution for improved responsiveness while maintaining signal stability.
- **Per-Tick Caching**: Signal scores are computed once per tick and cached, eliminating redundant calculations across position management, trailing, and dashboard systems.

### Risk & Equity Management

- **Equity Protection**:
  - **Min Equity Stop**: Hard stop if equity falls below a specific dollar amount.
  - **Max Drawdown Stop**: Stops trading if drawdown from peak exceeds a set limit.
  - **Daily Target**: Optional target profit to stop trading for the day.
- **Signal Dampening**: Position-aware system that penalizes signal scores when holding losing positions and raises entry thresholds during drawdown periods.
- **News Filter**: Automatically pauses trading before and after high-impact news events.
- **Trading Hours**: Configurable start and end times to avoid low-liquidity sessions.
- **Leverage Guard**: Pauses trading if account leverage changes unexpectedly.

### Position Management

- **Duplicate Signal Filter**: Uses "Zone Points" and minimum distance multipliers to prevent over-stacking positions.
- **Adaptive Trailing**:
  - Standard trailing stop logic.
  - **Signal-Based Adaptation**: Tightens or loosens TP/SL based on real-time changes in the Signal Score.
- **Loss Management**:
  - **Position Health Revalidation**: Continuously evaluates trade thesis using trend alignment, RSI zone, adverse ATR excursion, and swing structure — weighted health score determines hold/exit decisions.
  - **Scaled Partial Close**: Gradually reduces position volume as signal decays (75% → close 25%, 50% → close 50%, 25% → full exit).
  - **Dynamic SL Tightening**: Pulls stop-loss closer proportionally as position health weakens below a threshold.
  - **Break-Even Lock**: Moves SL to entry price once profit exceeds spread cost, protecting gains.
  - **Virtual SL + Re-entry**: Closes losing positions at the health threshold, then immediately re-enters at the current (better) price if the signal is still valid.
  - **Profit Offset SL**: Tightens SL of losing positions using accumulated profits from consecutive winning trades.

### Lot Sizing

- **Recovery Mode**: Increases lot size incrementally after equity drops for faster recovery.
- **Confidence Mode**: Increases lot size for high-confidence signals (e.g., Score > 8.0).
- **Velocity Boost**: Slightly increases position size if signal velocity (momentum) is accelerating.

### Dashboard & Alerts

- **On-Chart Dashboard**: Real-time display of Signal Scores, Equity, Drawdown, and Statistics.
- **Discord Integration**: Sends alerts to Discord via Webhook for:
  - Trade Open/Close
  - Equity Milestones
  - News Events
  - Trading Pauses/Resumes

## Strategy Logic

The strategy uses a **weighted scoring system** (0.0 - 10.0 scale). A trade is taken only if the _Total Score_ exceeds the `MinSignalScore` threshold (Default: 5.5).

**Note:** All scoring weights (Trend, Momentum, Volatility, etc.) are **fully adjustable** in the EA settings, allowing you to customize the strategy's sensitivity to different market conditions.

The score is calculated by summing up weights from specialized components:

1.  **Trend Score (Max 3.0)**:
    - **Alignment (+1.5)**: Fast EMA > Slow EMA (Buy) or Fast EMA < Slow EMA (Sell).
    - **Slope (+1.5)**: Fast EMA is rising (Buy) or falling (Sell).

2.  **Momentum Score (Max 3.0)**:
    - **RSI Sweet Spot (+1.0)**: RSI between 50-80 (Buy) or 20-50 (Sell).
    - **RSI Breakout (+0.5)**: RSI crossing key levels (60 for Buy, 40 for Sell).
    - **Body Momentum (+1.5)**: Current candle body is larger than the recent average.
    - **Impulse Boost**: Momentum score is multiplied by `(1 + ImpulseStrength)` where impulse combines:
      - Body acceleration (current vs. average body size)
      - Range expansion (current vs. average candle range)
      - Directional continuity (consecutive same-direction candles)

3.  **Volatility & Structure (Max 4.0)**:
    - **Chop Filter (Max 2.0)**: ATR ratio classifies trend strength vs. chop risk.
    - **Volatility (Max 1.0)**: Expanding volatility (ATR ratio > 1.2) adds to the score.
    - **Peak Breakout (+1.0)**: Price breaking above/below local extremes (recent 5-bar high/low).

4.  **Penalties (Deductions)**:
    - **Wick Rejection**: Long opposing wicks (e.g., long upper wick on a Buy signal) reduce the final score by the wick-to-body ratio.

5.  **Velocity Tracking**:
    - Tracks the _change_ in signal score between bars to detect strengthening or weakening moves.
    - Used for adaptive trailing stop adjustments and dynamic lot sizing.

6.  **Signal Smoothing (Blended Weighted Average)**:
    - Combines weighted average of recent closed candles with a dampened current candle contribution.
    - **SignalSmoothingCandles**: Number of closed candles to average (1-10, default per profile).
    - **CurrentCandleBlend**: Weight factor for the forming candle (0.0-1.0, where 0.0 = closed candles only, 1.0 = current candle only).
    - Results in smooth yet responsive signal scoring that adapts to market conditions.

**Entry Condition**: `Total Score` >= `MinSignalScore`
