Nyao Scalper is an automated trading EA designed for scalping on lower timeframes (M1, M5). It uses a **weighted signal scoring system** that aggregates data from multiple technical factors (Trend, Momentum, Volatility, Price Action) into a single confidence score (0.0 - 10.0).

It includes position management, adaptive trailing stops, and lot sizing based on equity performance and signal quality.

## Key Features

### Signal Scoring

The EA calculates a "Signal Score" for every tick based on:

- **Trend**: Fast/Slow EMA crossover and slope alignment.
- **Momentum**: RSI "sweet spots" (trending ranges), breakouts, and candle body momentum.
- **Impulse**: Detects price acceleration and directional continuity (consecutive candles).
- **Volatility**: ATR-based analysis to detect chopping vs. trending markets.
- **Price Action**: Penalizes signals with large opposing wicks (rejection) and rewards breakouts from local peaks.
- **Velocity**: Tracks the _change_ in signal score to detect strengthening or weakening moves.
- **Blended Weighted Average Signal Smoothing**: Combining recent closed candle signals with a configurable dampened current candle contribution for improved responsiveness while maintaining signal stability.
- **Multi-Bar EMA Slope** _(new in v42)_: Trend slope is measured over `SlopeLookback` bars instead of a single bar, reducing M1 whipsaw.
- **Dead-Market Filter** _(new in v42)_: When ATR collapses relative to its average (`ATR/AvgATR < MinVolRatioToTrade`), the signal is zeroed — the EA does not scalp a market too quiet to overcome costs.
- **New-Bar Entry Evaluation** _(new in v42, default on)_: With `EnableNewBarEntryOnly`, entries are evaluated once per closed bar (position management still runs every tick). This removes intrabar signal repaint and makes backtests representative of live behavior.
- **Per-Tick Caching**: Signal scores are computed once per tick and cached, eliminating redundant calculations across position management, trailing, and dashboard systems.

### Risk & Equity Management

- **Equity Protection**:
  - **Min Equity Stop**: Hard stop if equity falls below a specific dollar amount.
  - **Max Drawdown Stop**: Stops trading if drawdown from peak exceeds a set limit.
  - **Daily Target**: Optional target profit to stop trading for the day.
- **Basket Stop** _(new in v42)_: Portfolio-level backstop. Closes **all** positions and pauses when total floating loss exceeds a % of equity (`MaxBasketLossPct`) — protects against compounding drawdown from stacked positions, independent of per-position stops.
- **Max-Spread Filter** _(new in v42)_: Blocks new entries when the spread is too wide (fixed `MaxSpreadPoints`, or auto-derived from ATR via `MaxSpreadATRRatio`). Critical for cost control on M1 gold.
- **Signal Dampening**: Position-aware system that penalizes signal scores when holding losing positions and raises entry thresholds during drawdown periods.
- **News Filter**: Automatically pauses trading before and after high-impact news events.
- **Trading Hours**: Configurable start and end times to avoid low-liquidity sessions.
- **Leverage Guard**: Pauses trading if account leverage changes unexpectedly.

### Position Management

- **Duplicate Signal Filter**: Uses "Zone Points" and minimum distance multipliers to prevent over-stacking positions.
- **Adaptive Trailing**:
  - Standard trailing stop logic.
  - **Signal-Based Adaptation**: Tightens or loosens TP/SL based on real-time changes in the Signal Score.
- **Loss Management**:
  - **Position Health Revalidation**: Continuously evaluates trade thesis using trend alignment, RSI zone, adverse ATR excursion, and swing structure — weighted health score determines hold/exit decisions.
  - **Scaled Partial Close**: Gradually reduces position volume as signal decays (75% → close 25%, 50% → close 50%, 25% → full exit).
  - **Dynamic SL Tightening**: Pulls stop-loss closer proportionally as position health weakens below a threshold.
  - **Break-Even Lock**: Moves SL to entry price once profit exceeds spread cost, protecting gains.
  - **Virtual SL + Re-entry**: Closes losing positions at the health threshold, then immediately re-enters at the current (better) price if the signal is still valid.
  - **Profit Offset SL**: Tightens SL of losing positions using accumulated profits from consecutive winning trades.

### Lot Sizing

- **Recovery Mode**: Increases lot size incrementally after equity drops for faster recovery. _Guardrails (new in v42):_ capped at `MaxEquityDropLotSteps` total steps, and **disabled** while in a post-loss cooldown or while the basket is in floating loss — so size never scales up while actively bleeding.
- **Confidence Mode**: Increases lot size for high-confidence signals (e.g., Score > 8.0).
- **Velocity Boost**: Slightly increases position size if signal velocity (momentum) is accelerating.

### Dashboard & Alerts

- **On-Chart Dashboard**: Real-time display of Signal Scores, Equity, Drawdown, and Statistics.
- **Discord Integration**: Sends alerts to Discord via Webhook for:
  - Trade Open/Close
  - Equity Milestones
  - News Events
  - Trading Pauses/Resumes

## Strategy Logic

The strategy uses a **weighted scoring system** (0.0 - 10.0 scale). A trade is taken only if the _Total Score_ exceeds the `MinSignalScore` threshold (Default: 4.5).

> **v42 calibration note:** The Chop and Volatility components no longer add "free" points in a dead/quiet market (their low tiers default to `0.0`), so the score now discriminates regime instead of always rewarding it. Thresholds were lowered accordingly (~1.0) across all profiles. Additionally, when `ATR/AvgATR` falls below `MinVolRatioToTrade` the score is forced to `0` (no trade).

**Note:** All scoring weights (Trend, Momentum, Volatility, etc.) are **fully adjustable** in the EA settings, allowing you to customize the strategy's sensitivity to different market conditions.

The score is calculated by summing up weights from specialized components:

1.  **Trend Score (Max 3.0)**:
    - **Alignment (+1.5)**: Fast EMA > Slow EMA (Buy) or Fast EMA < Slow EMA (Sell).
    - **Slope (+1.5)**: Fast EMA is rising (Buy) or falling (Sell).

2.  **Momentum Score (Max 3.0)**:
    - **RSI Sweet Spot (+1.0)**: RSI between 50-80 (Buy) or 20-50 (Sell).
    - **RSI Breakout (+0.5)**: RSI crossing key levels (60 for Buy, 40 for Sell).
    - **Body Momentum (+1.5)**: Current candle body is larger than the recent average.
    - **Impulse Boost**: Momentum score is multiplied by `(1 + ImpulseStrength)` where impulse combines:
      - Body acceleration (current vs. average body size)
      - Range expansion (current vs. average candle range)
      - Directional continuity (consecutive same-direction candles)

3.  **Volatility & Structure (Max 4.0)**:
    - **Chop Filter (Max 2.0)**: ATR ratio classifies trend strength vs. chop risk. In a low-volatility (chop) regime the low tier contributes `0.0` by default — no free points.
    - **Volatility (Max 1.0)**: Expanding volatility (ATR ratio > 1.2) adds to the score; a quiet market adds `0.0` by default.
    - **Dead-Market Block**: If `ATR/AvgATR < MinVolRatioToTrade`, the entire signal is zeroed (the market is too quiet to scalp).
    - **Peak Breakout (+1.0)**: Price breaking above/below local extremes (recent 5-bar high/low).

4.  **Penalties (Deductions)**:
    - **Wick Rejection**: Long opposing wicks (e.g., long upper wick on a Buy signal) reduce the final score by the wick-to-body ratio.

5.  **Velocity Tracking**:
    - Tracks the _change_ in signal score between bars to detect strengthening or weakening moves.
    - Used for adaptive trailing stop adjustments and dynamic lot sizing.

6.  **Signal Smoothing (Blended Weighted Average)**:
    - Combines weighted average of recent closed candles with a dampened current candle contribution.
    - **SignalSmoothingCandles**: Number of closed candles to average (1-10, default per profile).
    - **CurrentCandleBlend**: Weight factor for the forming candle (0.0-1.0, where 0.0 = closed candles only, 1.0 = current candle only).
    - Results in smooth yet responsive signal scoring that adapts to market conditions.

**Entry Condition**: `Total Score` >= `MinSignalScore`

## Settings Profiles

Pre-configured settings files are available in the `settings/` folder. Load them via MetaTrader 5: **Charts → Templates** or manually copy values.

| Profile | Signal Threshold | Frequency | Risk | Best For |
|---------|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| **aggressive** | 3.5 | Very High | High | Maximum profit capture, larger lots, widest stops. High risk — use only with capital you can afford to lose. |
| **safe-aggressive** | 4.0 | High | Medium-Low | Fast entries with safe lot sizing, strong dampening, fast break-even locks. Best for small accounts ($200+). |
| **default** | 4.5 | Medium-High | Medium | M1 scalping-optimized baseline. Balanced signal response and risk management. |
| **balanced** | 5.0 | Medium | Medium | Quality entries with moderate exposure. Suitable for everyday trading. |
| **safe** | 6.0 | Low | Low | Highest conviction trades only, minimal exposure, tightest risk controls. Highest win rate. |

> Thresholds were lowered by ~1.0 vs. v41 because the scoring no longer adds "free" chop/volatility points (see the v42 calibration note above) — relative selectivity between profiles is unchanged.

### Profile Comparison

| Setting | Aggressive | Safe-Aggressive | Default | Balanced | Safe |
|---------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Base Lot | 0.03 | 0.01 | 0.01 | 0.01 | 0.01 |
| Max Lot | 0.10 | 0.03 | 0.05 | 0.05 | 0.01 |
| Max Open Orders | 12 | 8 | 8 | 6 | 3 |
| **Per-Trade SL (% equity)** | 1.5% | 0.8% | 1.0% | 0.8% | 0.5% |
| **Basket Stop (% equity)** | 12% | 7% | 8% | 6% | 3% |
| **Max Spread (ATR ratio)** | 0.35 | 0.28 | 0.25 | 0.22 | 0.20 |
| **Min Vol Ratio to Trade** | 0.50 | 0.55 | 0.60 | 0.65 | 0.70 |
| **Max DD Lot Steps** | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 0 |
| Slope Lookback | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 4 |
| Smoothing Candles | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 |
| Current Candle Blend | 0.60 | 0.45 | 0.40 | 0.35 | 0.25 |
| Max Holding Loss Pos | 4 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| Dampening Penalty | 1.0 | 1.8 | 1.5 | 1.5 | 2.0 |
| Break-Even Lock | 2.0x | 1.2x | 1.5x | 1.5x | 1.0x |
| Virtual SL Re-entry | On (50%) | On (65%) | On (75%) | On (75%) | Off |
| Dynamic Lots | On | On (capped) | On | On | Off |
| News Filter | 15/15 min | 25/25 min | 30/30 min | 30/30 min | 45/45 min |

> **Stop Loss units are now consistent** across all profiles — every profile uses `SLInputType = Percent of Equity`, so per-trade risk is comparable and scales with account size. (In v41 the SL unit type varied by profile, which made the magnitudes contradict each profile's stated philosophy.) Per-trade SL × Max Open Orders is kept roughly in line with each profile's Basket Stop.

### Recommended Profile by Account Size

| Account Size | Recommended | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| $100-200 | **safe-aggressive** | Fast entries but strict risk controls, capped lot sizing |
| $200-500 | **safe-aggressive** or **default** | Safe-aggressive for growth, default for stability |
| $500-1000 | **default** or **balanced** | Room for moderate exposure |
| $1000+ | Any profile | Account can absorb drawdowns from aggressive profiles |

## Installation

1.  **Copy File**:
    Place `nyao_scalper.mq5` into your MetaTrader 5 `Experts` folder.
    - File -> Open Data Folder -> MQL5 -> Experts

2.  **Dependencies**:
    Ensure `WinAPI` and `Controls` libraries are available (standard in MT5).

3.  **Allow WebRequest** (For Discord Alerts):
    - Go to `Tools` -> `Options` -> `Expert Advisors`.
    - Check "Allow WebRequest for listed URL".
    - Add your Discord Webhook URL (if using alerts).

4.  **Compile**:
    Open the file in MetaEditor and press `F7` or click "Compile".

5.  **Run**:
    Drag the EA onto a chart (Recommended: XAUUSD, EURUSD on M1/M5).

## Alternative Compilation (VS Code)

If you prefer coding in Visual Studio Code, you can compile `.mq5` files directly using the **MQL5/MQL4** extension (also known as Buraq).

1.  **Install Extension**:
    - Open VS Code Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
    - Search for `Buraq MQL5` or `sarfrazfrompk`.
    - Install **[MQL5/MQL4](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sarfrazfrompk.buraq-mql5-mql4)** by `sarfrazfrompk`.

2.  **Configure Path**:
    - Go to Extension Settings (`Ctrl+,`).
    - Search for `MQL5`.
    - Set `Mql5: Metaeditor Path` to your `metaeditor64.exe` location.
    - _Example:_ `C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 5\metaeditor64.exe`

3.  **Compile**:
    - Open `nyao_scalper.mq5` in VS Code.
    - Right-click anywhere in the code.
    - Select **MQL5: Compile**.
    - Check the Output terminal for success or errors.

## Backtesting Honestly

Results in the Strategy Tester only mean something if the test mirrors live conditions. For this EA specifically:

1.  **Use "Every tick based on real ticks"** (Strategy Tester → Modeling). Lower-fidelity modes can misrepresent intrabar behavior. With `EnableNewBarEntryOnly = true` (default) entries are decided on bar close, so `1 minute OHLC` is also reasonable for a faster sweep — but validate the final candidate on real ticks.
2.  **Include realistic costs.** Set your broker's **commission** in the tester and test on a **realistic spread** (ideally the symbol's actual spread, not 0). On M1 XAUUSD, spread + commission is the dominant cost — a backtest without them is meaningless.
3.  **Know what the tester can't see.** `CalendarValueHistory` (the high-impact **news filter**) generally returns nothing inside the Strategy Tester, so backtests run **without** news protection that live trading has. Treat tester drawdowns around news as optimistic.
4.  **Validate out-of-sample.** With this many tunable inputs, in-sample optimization overfits easily. Tune on one period, then confirm on a separate untouched period (or use walk-forward) before trusting a profile.
5.  **Sanity-check the new v42 guards** via the journal: confirm entries fire only on bar close, that trades are skipped when spread is wide or ATR has collapsed, and that the **Basket Stop** closes everything once floating loss crosses `MaxBasketLossPct`.

> No equity curve is bundled with this repo. Capture your own tester report (real ticks + commission, out-of-sample) before running any profile on a funded account.

## What's New in v42

- **Max-spread entry filter** and **portfolio basket stop** (close-all on aggregate floating loss).
- **Drawdown lot-scaling guardrails**: capped steps; never scales up during cooldown or while the basket is in loss.
- **New-bar entry evaluation** (stable signals, honest backtests) and **dead-market filter** (skip collapsed-ATR regimes).
- **Multi-bar EMA slope**; chop/volatility no longer add free points (thresholds recalibrated).
- **Consistent Stop-Loss units** across all profiles (percent of equity), re-tuned so each profile matches its stated aim.
- Code cleanup (unified entry-condition logic) and repo hygiene (`.ex5` no longer tracked).
